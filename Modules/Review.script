We just learned how to use JavaScript modules. Let's review what we learned:

Modules in JavaScript are reusable pieces of code that can be exported from one program and imported for use in another program.

-'module.exports' exports the module for use in another program.
-'require()' imports the module for use in the current program.

ES6 introduced a more flexible, easier syntax to export modules:

-default exports use 'export default' to export JavaScript objects, functions, and primitive data types.
-named exports use the 'export' keyword to export data in variables.
-named exports can be aliased with the 'as' keyword.
-'import' is a keyword that imports any object, function, or data type.
