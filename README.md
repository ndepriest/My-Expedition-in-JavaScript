# My-Expedition-in-JavaScript

## Objective
This repository is a collection of Javascript that I have learned and applied, and it will act both as a resource and documentiation to what I have achieved during my time working with JavaScript. I know little to nothing about JavaScript as it stands now, but with this repository I hope to create a portfolio of my achievements and to document my progress as I progress. Let's Roll!
